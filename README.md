# PostABlog-website
The MyBlogPost website will allow registered users to create their own blog and unregistered users to view blog postings. Our goal is to produce a similar type of service that allows users to login using their username and password or register by providing their name, email address and image. Registered users will be able to post blogs and make comments on blog entries. The system will be required to support usage by multiple users. Additionally, unregistered users must be able to view the content but will not be able to comment on the posts. Blog comments will be updated in real-time.
